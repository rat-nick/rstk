# Preprocessing

To preprocess data, simply use the `Preprocessor` class located in `rstk.preprocessor` module.

```python
from rstk.preprocessor import Preprocessor
```

The idea of the preprocessor class is that every preprocessing step should return the instance of the preprocessor for easy method chaining.
